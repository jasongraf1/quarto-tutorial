  abstract = {English undoubtedly is the lingua franca of pop culture. In music performances, American English is the dominant voice. Audiences are used to hearing an American-influenced accent in many popular genres. Nevertheless, the ``going local'' trend advocated in the British punk era perpetuates in modern music and motivates artists to perform in their local voice. The audience is a driving force behind such trends, but its role has been widely neglected in research. This explorative folk-linguistic study gives center stage to the audience and examines British attitudes toward the American accent both in general and in music, focusing on methodological aspects of attitudes of research in performances. Results show that respondents accept an Americanized singing style and consider it the default mode. However, local British accents are a welcome change and support cultural independence. Findings indicate the importance of working with music stimuli to gather more detailed results on language perception.},

Written by an expert with twenty years of experience in this field, the book is focused on the principles and fundamental concepts for application, rather than on specific tools or platforms. Each chapter contains examples of projects, tools, or platforms that demonstrate these principles in action. The book is structured to complement courses on digital humanities and provides a series of modules, each of which is organized around a set of concerns and topics, thought experiments and questions, as well as specific discussion of the ways in which tools and platforms work. The book covers a wide range of topics and clearly details how to integrate the acquisition of expertise in data, metadata, classification, interface, visualization, network analysis, topic modelling, data mining, mapping, and web presentation with issues in intellectual property, sustainability, privacy, and the ethical use of information. Written in an accessible and engaging manner, The Digital Humanities Coursebook will be a useful guide for anyone teaching or studying a course in the areas of digital humanities, library and information science, English, or computer science. The book will provide a framework for direct engagement with digital humanities and, as such, should be of interest to others working across the humanities too"--},

  abstract = {Mass media routinely present data on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diffusion with graphs that use either a log scale or a linear scale. We show that the choice of the scale adopted on these graphs has important consequences on how people understand and react to the information conveyed. In particular, we find that when we show the number of COVID-19 related deaths on a logarithmic scale, people have a less accurate understanding of how the pandemic has developed, make less accurate predictions on its evolution, and have different policy preferences than when they are exposed to a linear scale. Consequently, merely changing the scale the data is presented on can alter public policy preferences and the level of worry about the pandemic, despite the fact that people are routinely exposed to COVID-19 related information. Providing the public with information in ways they understand better can help improving the response to COVID-19, thus, mass media and policymakers communicating to the general public should always describe the evolution of the pandemic using a graph on a linear scale, at least as a default option. Our results suggest that framing matters when communicating to the public.},

Our systematic review of research articles published in top physiology journals (n = 703) suggests that, as scientists, we urgently need to change our practices for presenting continuous data in small sample size studies. Papers rarely included scatterplots, box plots, and histograms that allow readers to critically evaluate continuous data. Most papers presented continuous data in bar and line graphs. This is problematic, as many different data distributions can lead to the same bar or line graph. The full data may suggest different conclusions from the summary statistics. We recommend training investigators in data presentation, encouraging a more complete presentation of data, and changing journal editorial policies. Investigators can quickly make univariate scatterplots for small sample size studies using our Excel templates.},

The purpose of this study is to test various stylistic, diatopic and historical factors, with the help of both qualitative and quantitative methods. Findings from earlier research are tested against further corpus evidence, while I provide a broader statistical basis and more illustrative examples than in previous studies. I also address more theoretical issues, such as the principles behind the production of lyrics and the question of whether pop song lyrics can be categorised in terms of `spoken' versus `written' or `formal' versus `informal'. I argue that pop lyrics constitute a rather special register. Finally, I outline areas of further study.},
